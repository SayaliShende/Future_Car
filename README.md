## Linear Regression and feature selection through forward and backward selection.
In response to a car manufacturer's quest for an energy-efficient solution, this analysis employs data-driven insights to design a more fuel-efficient automobile. The first section focuses on meticulous data cleansing, utilizing robust techniques to ensure data quality. A linear regression model is constructed in the next step to accurately predict miles per gallon (MPG) based on vehicle attributes. The third section involves model optimization using a selection technique, with a subsequent comparison against the initial model. Finally, in the last section, the model's ability to achieve the specified goals is evaluated, highlighting the critical attributes contributing to higher MPG. This comprehensive approach aims to guide the manufacturer in crafting an innovative and fuel-efficient vehicle tailored to market demands.
